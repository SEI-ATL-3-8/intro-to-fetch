## Goals

1. Add the data we grabbed to the DOM

# 

## Grabbing data from the web
In our javascript files, we can run the built-in `fetch` method to grab data from any URL.

fetch then log:
  - do the promise fake-out
  - .then
  - 2-layer onion
  - they move it into click handler; retype don't copy-paste

adding to dom:
  - 3-step process
  - we do user names together
  - they do email then image
  - they can also do any other attrs they want

better adding to dom:
  - put them all into a single div
  - give the elements classes for styling

stretch:
  - move user creation into its own function
  - add an input to specify number of results
